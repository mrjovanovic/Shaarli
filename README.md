# Shaarli Clean

## About

This is a (mostly) personal fork of the community edition of Shaarli, a fantastic minimalist bookmarking service. The original can be found at: <https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli>

I have made the following alterations, mostly in the main theme and templates:
* Shaarli uses Unicode for icons instead of images (this was the main reason for forking it)
* Side text ("Shaare your links...") has been removed.
* The shadows and positioning of the icons in the links list have been cleaned up.
* The Daily Shaarli does not use any newspaper-like images, excluding the paper texture in the background.

It should look best with the [Serious theme](https://github.com/mrjovanovic/serious-theme-shaarli). You will find screenshots there.
